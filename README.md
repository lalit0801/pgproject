PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Paying guest accommodation 
Since the house rental soars have been increasing day by day, it is becoming the big issue for the poor or middle class students to get a house on rent. Especially, house for rent is good for the big families, or small families (couples and a kid). But for students, it is not at all a good idea to stay in house. Because, students will not get enough time to study, and it becomes difficult for them to clean the house, clean bathrooms and toilets, etc. Hence, being a student, it’s really a better idea to go with Paying Guest accommodation. If you are looking for houses in the city of Mumbai, just drop your idea, as cost of the house rent seems to be high.
